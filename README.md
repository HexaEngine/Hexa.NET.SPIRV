# Hexa.NET.SPIRV

Hexa.NET.SPIRV is a minimal C# wrapper for the SPIRV-Cross and SPIRV-Reflect library, providing a thin, 1:1 binding to their C functions.

## Features

- **Minimal Wrapper**: Provides a direct, 1:1 mapping to the SPIRV-Cross and SPIRV-Reflect C functions, staying true to the original API.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works across all platforms supported by SPIRV-Cross and SPIRV-Reflect, including Windows, Linux, Android, and macOS.
- **Pre-Built Native Libraries**: The package includes pre-built native libraries, so you don't need to worry about installing SPIRV-Cross and SPIRV-Reflect separately.
